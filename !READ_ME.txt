Hello!

Welcome to the Senior Design project for the Fall semester of '23 Electrical Engineering Class.
This project contains the PCB project and Gerber files for a fresh take on the CheapFocer BLDC Motor driver.
While the boards look completely different from each other, many of the components and connections are the same, 
it is the layout of the board that has changed. This updated layout has yet to be physically verified.

Some areas of potential concern are as follows-
Inductive kickback from the MOSFET driving circuit.
Traces under the microcontroller with high current throughput may not be large enough to accommodate power.
Roundabout traces may lead to EMC susceptibility. 

If any questions should arise, please contact oldnicj@dunwoody.edu and I will do my best to get back to you. 
in a timely manner.
